						<p>Cuban music has been my favorite genre of music to study and perform for many years. As a pianist and percussionist, it has always been a beautiful blend of rhythmic and harmonic complexity while also having a groove that catches the attention of the average listener. My study and performance of Cuban music has always been outside of the island, and this last summer was my first opportunity to travel to Cuba. Even though I knew amount about the country and had seen photos and videos, it was still incredibly significant for me to see it first hand. I experienced the amazing music and kind people and also saw the poverty of the country.
						<br><br>The trip was significant for the college to establish a connection with Cuba that extended beyond music performance and into music business and recording arts, and will help to foster more connections in the future into other artistic areas of the college. For me, it was an experience that has changed my perspective and my teaching, because I can now speak about what I saw and heard myself in Havana.
